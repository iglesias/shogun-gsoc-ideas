<h1>Ideas for Google Summer of Code 2014 Projects</h1>

Shogun is a software toolbox for machine learning algorithms, with a special focus on large-scale applications. During Google Summer of Code 2014 we are looking forward to extending our library with both state-of-the-art and fundamental machine learning algorithms. <br /><br />

Below is listed a set of suggestions for projects. If you have your own concrete idea, or want to solve a task proposed during previous years that has not been tackled yet - talk to us! We might be interested.<br /><br />

<!-- Project description -->
<p align="justify">
Deep Learning has recently attracted a lot of attention in the Machine Learning community for its ability to learn features that allow high performance in a variety of tasks ranging from Computer Vision to Speech Recognition and Bioinformatics. The main goal of this task is to integrate essential building blocks of deep learning algorithms into Shogun. This includes Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and training algorithms, Deep Belief Networks (DBN), feed-forward networks and convolutional networks. The architecture and software design for flexible usage and adaptation of models should be created to build a foundation for integrating many more models, evaluation methods and training algorithms in the future. Speaking of details, this idea considers implementation of some software foundation for deep learning and the first few algorithms (RBMs and training, stacking of RBM’s, wake-sleep for DBN’s, discriminative fine-tuning with backprop, FFN).<br /><br />

This idea is a great chance to learn the deep learning approach and essential principles of implementing deep learning algorithms. With such a serious attention being drawn to deep learning this is an important skill for any researcher or engineer working with data. <br /><br />
